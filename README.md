In this task using the daily stock data I have first calculated the daily change and then the monthly change of the stock.<br>
<br>
Afterwards, that data is used to identify the top performing and non performing stocks of each month of resprective year.<br>
<br>
I have used the pandasql library, to expolit the advantages of SQL language within a pandas dataframe.
